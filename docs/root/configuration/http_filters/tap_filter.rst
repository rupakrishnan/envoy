Tap
===

* :ref:`v2 API reference <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.http.tap.v2alpha.Tap>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.http.tap*.

.. attention::

  The tap filter is experimental and is currently under active development. There is currently a
  very limited set of match conditions, output configuration, output sinks, etc. Capabilities will
  be expanded over time and the configuration structures are likely to change.

The HTTP tap filter is used to interpose on and record HTTP traffic. At a high level, the
configuration is composed of two pieces:

1. :ref:`Match configuration <envoy_api_msg_service.tap.v2alpha.MatchPredicate>`: a list of
   conditions under which the filter will match an HTTP request and begin a tap session.
2. :ref:`Output configuration <envoy_api_msg_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputConfig>`: a list of output
   sinks that the filter will write the matched and tapped data to.

Each of these concepts will be covered incrementally over the course of several example
configurations in the following section.

Example configuration
---------------------

Example filter configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: envoy.filters.http.tap
  config:
    common_config:
      admin_config:
        config_id: test_config_id

The previous snippet configures the filter for control via the :http:post:`/tap` admin handler.
See the following section for more details.

.. _config_http_filters_tap_admin_handler:

Admin handler
-------------

When the HTTP filter specifies an :ref:`admin_config
<envoy_api_msg_config.common.tap.v2alpha.AdminConfig>`, it is configured for admin control and
the :http:post:`/tap` admin handler will be installed. The admin handler can be used for live
tapping and debugging of HTTP traffic. It works as follows:

1. A POST request is used to provide a valid tap configuration. The POST request body can be either
   the JSON or YAML representation of the :ref:`TapConfig
   <envoy_api_msg_service.tap.v2alpha.TapConfig>` message.
2. If the POST request is accepted, Envoy will stream :ref:`HttpBufferedTrace
   <envoy_api_msg_data.tap.v2alpha.HttpBufferedTrace>` messages (serialized to JSON) until the admin
   request is terminated.

An example POST body:

.. code-block:: yaml

  config_id: test_config_id
  tap_config:
    match_config:
      and_match:
        rules:
          - http_request_headers_match:
              headers:
                - name: foo
                  exact_match: bar
          - http_response_headers_match:
              headers:
                - name: bar
                  exact_match: baz
    output_config:
      sinks:
        - streaming_admin: {}

The preceding configuration instructs the tap filter to match any HTTP requests in which a request
header ``foo: bar`` is present AND a response header ``bar: baz`` is present. If both of these
conditions are met, the request will be tapped and streamed out the admin endpoint.

Another example POST body:

.. code-block:: yaml

  config_id: test_config_id
  tap_config:
    match_config:
      or_match:
        rules:
          - http_request_headers_match:
              headers:
                - name: foo
                  exact_match: bar
          - http_response_headers_match:
              headers:
                - name: bar
                  exact_match: baz
    output_config:
      sinks:
        - streaming_admin: {}

The preceding configuration instructs the tap filter to match any HTTP requests in which a request
header ``foo: bar`` is present OR a response header ``bar: baz`` is present. If either of these
conditions are met, the request will be tapped and streamed out the admin endpoint.

Another example POST body:

.. code-block:: yaml

  config_id: test_config_id
  tap_config:
    match_config:
      any_match: true
    output_config:
      sinks:
        - streaming_admin: {}

The preceding configuration instructs the tap filter to match any HTTP requests. All requests will
be tapped and streamed out the admin endpoint.

Output format
-------------

Each output sink has an associated :ref:`format
<envoy_api_enum_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputSink.Format>`. The default format is
:ref:`JSON_BODY_AS_BYTES
<envoy_api_enum_value_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputSink.Format.JSON_BODY_AS_BYTES>`. This format is
easy to read JSON, but has the downside that body data is base64 encoded. In the case that the tap
is known to be on human readable data, the :ref:`JSON_BODY_AS_STRING
<envoy_api_enum_value_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputSink.Format.JSON_BODY_AS_STRING>` format may be
more user friendly. See the reference documentation for more information on other available formats.

An example of a streaming admin tap configuration that uses the :ref:`JSON_BODY_AS_STRING
<envoy_api_enum_value_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputSink.Format.JSON_BODY_AS_STRING>` format:

.. code-block:: yaml

  config_id: test_config_id
  tap_config:
    match_config:
      any_match: true
    output_config:
      sinks:
        - format: JSON_BODY_AS_STRING
          streaming_admin: {}

Buffered body limits
--------------------

For buffered taps, Envoy will limit the amount of body data that is tapped to avoid OOM situations.
The default limit is 1KiB for both received (request) and transmitted (response) data. This is
configurable via the :ref:`max_buffered_rx_bytes
<envoy_api_field_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputConfig.max_buffered_rx_bytes>` and
:ref:`max_buffered_tx_bytes
<envoy_api_field_service.tap.v2alpha.OutputConfig.max_buffered_tx_bytes>` settings.

Streaming matching
------------------

The tap filter supports "streaming matching." This means that instead of waiting until the end of
the request/response sequence, the filter will match incrementally as the request proceeds. I.e.,
first the request headers will be matched, then the request body if present, then the request
trailers if present, then the response headers if present, etc.

In the future, the filter will support streaming output. Currently only :ref:`fully buffered output
<envoy_api_msg_data.tap.v2alpha.HttpBufferedTrace>` is implemented. However, even in the current
implementation, if a tap is configured to match request headers and the request headers match,
even if there is no response (upstream failure, etc.) the request will still be tapped and sent
to the configured output.

Statistics
----------

The tap filter outputs statistics in the *http.<stat_prefix>.tap.* namespace. The :ref:`stat prefix
<envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stat_prefix>`
comes from the owning HTTP connection manager.
