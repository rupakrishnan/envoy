# This script is invoked from quiche.BUILD to tweak QUICHE source files into a
# form usable by Envoy. Transformations performed here:
#
# - Move subtree under quiche/ base dir, for clarity in #include statements.
# - Rewrite include directives for platform/impl files to point to the directory
#   containing Envoy's QUICHE platform implementation.
# - Fix include directives for non-platform/impl files to remove
#   "net/third_party" from the path. (This is an artifact of Chromium source
#   tree structure.)

# Determine base directory of unmodified QUICHE source files. In practice, this
# ends up being "external/com_googlesource_quiche".
